        <h3>Problem Statement 5</h3>
        <p>Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted
            arrays.</p>
        <h4>Given Array</h4>
        <div id="element1"></div>
        <h4>Expected output</h4>
        <div id="element2"></div>
        <h3>Problem Statement 6</h3>
        <p>Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the
            array nums = [0,1,4,4,5,6,7] might become</p>
        <p>[4,5,6,7,0,1,4] if it was rotated 4 times.
            [0,1,4,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.</p>
        <p>Given the sorted rotated array nums that may contain duplicates, return the minimum element of this array.
